# Controlling Language Model Generation with NVIDIA's LogitsProcessorZoo

> **Struggling to get language models to follow your instructions?**

NVIDIA's [LogitsProcessorZoo](https://github.com/NVIDIA/logits-processor-zoo/tree/main) provides powerful tools for controling the behavior of language models during text generation. Whether you want to control sequence lengths, enforce specific phrases, or guide multiple-choice answers, this library offers precise control over model outputs. In this post, we'll dive into its features and show how you can use it to refine your AI workflows.

## What Are Logits in Language Models?

![generation process](https://jalammar.github.io/images/gpt2/gpt2-output.png)
Taken from: https://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-gpt2/

Logits are the raw, unnormalized scores generated by language models for each token in their vocabulary. These scores are transformed into probabilities via the **softmax** function, guiding the model in selecting the next token.

Here's an example of how logits fit into the generation process:

```python
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForCausalLM
import torch

# Load a model and tokenizer
model_name = "meta-llama/Llama-3.2-1B"
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_name, torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16, device_map="auto")

# Input text
prompt = "The capital of France is"
inputs = tokenizer(prompt, return_tensors="pt").to(model.device)

# Get logits
with torch.inference_mode():
    outputs = model(**inputs)
    logits = outputs.logits

# Logits for the last token
last_token_logits = logits[:, -1, :]
```

These logits represent the model's confidence for each potential next word. Using softmax, we can turn them into probabilities and decode them into the generated text:

```python
# Prediction for the next token
next_token_probs = torch.nn.functional.softmax(last_token_logits, dim=-1)

# Decode logits to generate text
predicted_token_ids = torch.argmax(next_token_probs, dim=-1)
generated_text = tokenizer.batch_decode(predicted_token_ids, skip_special_tokens=True)
print("Generated Text:", generated_text[0])

>>> Generated Text: Paris
```

While this pipeline works for general text generation, **raw logits are not optimized for task-specific constraints or custom behaviors**. This is where logit processing becomes indispensable.

## Why Process Logits?

Raw logits often fall short when controlling output behavior. For example:

- **Lack of constraints:** They might not adhere to required formats, grammar rules, or predefined structures.
- **Overgeneralization:** The model could prioritize generic responses instead of specific, high-quality outputs.
- **Task misalignment:** Sequences may end too early, be overly verbose, or miss critical details.

Logit processing enables us to tweak the model's behavior by modifying these raw scores before generation.

## NVIDIA's LogitsProcessorZoo

NVIDIA's [LogitsProcessorZoo](https://github.com/NVIDIA/logits-processor-zoo) simplifies post-processing of logits with modular components tailored for specific tasks.
Let's explore its features and see how to use them. To follow along, head over to
[the notebook](https://huggingface.co/datasets/ariG23498/quick-notebooks/blob/main/processors.ipynb) and experiment with the logit processors.

Install the library using:

```bash
pip install logits-processor-zoo
```

To demonstrate the processors, we'll create a simple `LLMRunner` class that initializes a model and tokenizer, exposing a `generate_response` method.

```python
# Adapted from: https://github.com/ariG23498/logits-processor-zoo/blob/main/example_notebooks/transformers/utils.py
class LLMRunner:
    def __init__(self, model_name="meta-llama/Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct"):
        self.tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)

        self.model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(
            model_name,
            torch_dtype=torch.float16,
            device_map="auto",
        )

    def generate_response(self, prompts, logits_processor_list=None, max_tokens=1000):
        if logits_processor_list is None:
            logits_processor_list = []

        for prompt in prompts:
            conversation = [
                {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
                {"role": "user", "content": prompt},
            ]
            inputs = self.tokenizer.apply_chat_template(
                conversation,
                tokenize=True,
                add_generation_prompt=True,
                return_tensors="pt",
                return_dict=True,
            ).to(self.model.device)

            with torch.inference_mode():
                outputs = self.model.generate(
                    **inputs,
                    max_new_tokens=max_tokens,
                    min_new_tokens=1,
                    logits_processor=LogitsProcessorList(logits_processor_list),
                )

            gen_output = self.tokenizer.batch_decode(
                outputs, skip_special_tokens=True, clean_up_tokenization_spaces=False
            )
            # Extract only the generated output after the original input length
            generated_text = gen_output[0][
                len(
                    self.tokenizer.decode(
                        inputs["input_ids"][0], skip_special_tokens=True
                    )
                ) :
            ].strip()

            print(f"Prompt: {prompt}")
            print()
            print(f"LLM response:\n{generated_text}")

runner = LLMRunner()
```

### 1. **GenLengthLogitsProcessor**

Control the length of generated sequences by adjusting the likelihood of the end-of-sequence (EOS) token.

This processor is particularly useful in scenarios where the desired length of generated text plays a
crucial role, such as generating concise summaries, restricting verbose outputs, or tailoring responses
to specific use cases. For instance, it can help ensure that a chatbot provides short and meaningful
responses while maintaining grammatical integrity by completing sentences when required.

```py
example_prompts =[
    "Tell me a story about a kid lost in forest."
]

# generate short response
print(runner.generate_response(
    example_prompts,
    [GenLengthLogitsProcessor(runner.tokenizer, boost_factor=0.1, p=2, complete_sentences=True)]
))

>>> Prompt: Tell me a story about a kid lost in forest.

LLM response:
Once upon a time, in a dense forest, there lived a young boy named Timmy. Timmy was on a family camping trip with his parents and little sister, Emma. They had been walking for hours, and the dense trees seemed to close in around them. As the sun began to set, Timmy realized he had wandered away from his family.

At first, Timmy didn't panic. He thought about calling out for his parents and Emma, but his voice was hoarse from singing campfire songs. He looked around, but the trees seemed to stretch on forever, making it impossible to see any familiar landmarks.

As the darkness grew thicker, Timmy's fear began to creep in.
```

```py
# generate long response
print(runner.generate_response(
    example_prompts,
    [GenLengthLogitsProcessor(runner.tokenizer, boost_factor=-10.0, p=0, complete_sentences=False)]
))

>>> Prompt: Tell me a story about a kid lost in forest.

LLM response:
Once upon a time, in a dense and vibrant forest, there lived a young boy named Max. Max was an adventurous and curious 8-year-old who loved exploring the outdoors. One sunny afternoon, while wandering through the forest, he stumbled upon a narrow path he had never seen before.

Excited by the discovery, Max decided to follow the path and see where it would lead. The forest was teeming with life, and the sunlight filtering through the trees created a magical atmosphere. Max walked for about 20 minutes, his eyes scanning the surroundings for any signs of civilization.

As the sun began to set, casting a warm orange glow over the forest, Max realized he was lost. He had no phone, no wallet, and no way to communicate with his family. Panic started to set in, and Max began to feel scared and alone.

Panicked, Max started to run through the forest, his heart racing and his legs trembling. He stumbled upon a clearing and saw a faint light in the distance. As he approached, he saw a small cabin in the center of the clearing. Smoke was rising from the chimney, and Max could hear the sound of someone singing a gentle tune.

Without hesitation, Max rushed towards the cabin and knocked on the door. A kindly old woman answered, and when she saw Max, she welcomed him with a warm smile. "Hello, young traveler," she said. "What are you doing out here all alone?"

Max explained his situation, and the old woman listened carefully. She then offered Max a warm cup of tea and a comfortable place to rest. As they talked, Max learned that the old woman was a forest guide, and she had been searching for him all along.

The old woman took Max on a journey through the forest, teaching him about the different plants, animals, and secrets of the forest. Max learned about the importance of taking care of the environment and respecting the creatures that lived there.

As the night fell, the old woman invited Max to stay with her for the night. Max was grateful for the kindness and warmth of the old woman, and he drifted off to sleep with a heart full of joy and a mind full of wonder.

The next morning, the old woman helped Max find his way back to the path he had taken. As they said their goodbyes, the old woman handed Max a small gift â€“ a small wooden acorn with a note that read, "Remember, the forest is full of magic, but it's also full of kindness. Always look for it."

Max returned home, forever changed by his experience in the forest. He never forgot the kindness of the old woman and the magic of the forest, and he always carried the lessons he learned with him.

From that day on, Max became known as the forest explorer, and his love for the outdoors was only matched by his love for the people he met along the way. And whenever he looked up at the stars, he remembered the wise words of the old woman: "The forest is full of magic, but it's also full of kindness. Always look for it."
```

In the examples above, we have used the `GenLengthLogitsProcessor` to both shorten and lengthen the 
our generated response from the model.

### 2. **CiteFromPromptLogitsProcessor**

Boost or diminish tokens from the prompt to encourage similar outputs.

This is particularly valuable in tasks requiring context retention, such as answering questions based
on a passage, generating summaries with specific details, or producing consistent outputs in dialogue systems.
For example, in the given code snippet where a user review is analyzed, this processor ensures the
model generates a response closely tied to the review's content, such as emphasizing opinions about
the product's price. 

```py
example_prompts =[
    """
    A user review: very soft, colorful, expensive but deserves its price, stylish.

    What is the user's opinion about the product's price?
    """,
]

# Cite from the Prompt
print(runner.generate_response(
    example_prompts,
    [CiteFromPromptLogitsProcessor(runner.tokenizer, example_prompts, boost_factor=5.0)],
    max_tokens=50,
))

>>> Prompt: 
    A user review: very soft, colorful, expensive but deserves its price, stylish.
    
    What is the user's opinion about the product's price?
    

LLM response:
Based on the user review, the user's opinion about the product's price is: the user is very satisfied, but the price is expensive, but the product is stylish, soft, and colorful, which is the price the user is willing to pay
```

Notice how the generation cites the input prompt.

### 3. **ForceLastPhraseLogitsProcessor**

Force the model to include a specific phrase before ending its output.

This processor is especially useful in structured content generation scenarios where consistency or
adherence to a specific format is crucial. It is ideal for tasks like generating citations,
formal reports, or outputs requiring specific phrasing to maintain a professional or organized presentation.

```py
example_prompts = [

With each generation we were able to add the `phrase` string right at the end of the generation.

### 4. **MultipleChoiceLogitsProcessor**

Guide the model to answer multiple-choice questions by selecting one of the given options.

This processor is particularly useful in tasks requiring strict adherence to a structured answer format,
such as quizzes, surveys, or decision-making support systems.

```py
example_prompts = [
"""
I am getting a lot of calls during the day. What is more important for me to consider when I buy a new phone?
0. Camera
1. Battery
2. Operating System
3. Screen Resolution

Answer:
""",
]

mclp = MultipleChoiceLogitsProcessor(
    runner.tokenizer,
    choices=["0", "1", "2", "3"],
    delimiter="."
)

print(runner.generate_response(example_prompts, [mclp], max_tokens=1))

>>> Prompt: 
I am getting a lot of calls during the day. What is more important for me to consider when I buy a new phone?
0. Camera
1. Battery
2. Operating System
3. Screen Resolution

Answer:


LLM response:
1
```

Here our model does not generate anything other than the choice. This is an immensely helpful attribute while
working with agnets or using models for multiple choice questions.
